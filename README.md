## 🧠 About Me

My background in the **music and live event industry** gives me a strong business perspective.  
I’ve managed **releases, budgets, ad campaigns** (Meta, Google), and organized **40+ concerts** — experiences that taught me how to connect **data with revenue, engagement, and audience behavior**.

I enjoy turning messy data into meaningful stories — whether it’s **campaign ROI, funnel drop-offs, or product performance trends**.  
My goal is always to make data **clear, actionable, and valuable** for marketing, growth, or product teams.
